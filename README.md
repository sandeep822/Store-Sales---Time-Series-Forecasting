# Store-Sales---Time-Series-Forecasting
The problem at hand involves leveraging machine learning techniques for time-series forecasting to predict store sales for a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer, Corporación Favorita. Accurate sales prediction is crucial for optimizing inventory management and satisfying customer demands in the grocery retail industry. The dataset provided includes time series information such as dates, store numbers, product families, promotions, and unit sales. The objective is to build a robust predictive model capable of accurately forecasting the unit sales for various product families at different Favorita stores. The challenges inherent in the retail domain, such as varying seasonal tastes, product marketing dynamics, and the impact of promotions, make this a complex yet practical problem. Successful solutions can contribute to minimizing overstock, reducing food waste, and enhancing overall customer satisfaction in the grocery retail sector.The dataset comprises several files, including train.csv (training data), test.csv (test data), sample_submission.csv (sample submission format), stores.csv (store metadata), oil.csv (daily oil prices), and holidays_events.csv (holidays and events metadata). The primary fields in the training data include store number, product family, on-promotion status, and the target variable—sales.

time series, possibly representing sales and oil prices (dcoilwtico) with corresponding dates from 2013 to 2017. The inclusion of "onpromotion" suggests that the dataset may also include information about promotions. The repetition of "sales" and "dcoilwtico" across different time points and years implies a tracking of these metrics over time. The consistent numerical progression from 103 to 100 suggests a decrease in values, possibly indicating a trend or pattern. The dataset seems structured to observe variations in sales, oil prices, and promotional activities over the specified period.

fits and transforms the training data (X_train[col_names_classic_ml]) through the defined preprocessing pipeline (preprocess_pipe). The pipeline consists of three main steps. First, it encodes categorical features using Target Encoder for selected columns. Second, it applies cyclical transformations (sine and cosine) to the time-related features (day_of_week, month, year). Lastly, it performs polynomial feature engineering up to the second degree and scales the entire dataset using MinMaxScaler. The final transformation is encapsulated in a Pandas DataFrame with columns explicitly named according to the transformed features specified in col_names_classic_ml_transformed. The fitting and transformation process aims to prepare the data for training a machine learning model, ensuring that it captures both temporal patterns and interactions between features while maintaining numerical stability through scaling. The execution time for each step of the pipeline is also provided.
